### Imp1

Codes of 1st problem in implementations list.

- **imp1_1.py**: a program which gets a zero-sum game and computes its value and optimal strategies
- **imp1_2.py**: a program which gets a general-sum two-person game and analyze cooperative theory for it
(find agreement point, threat strategies and profit-sharing policy)

### Imp7

Codes of 7th problem in implementations list.

- **imp7_1.py**: a program which gets the preference matrix of boys and girls and find a boy-optimal and a
girl-optimal stable marriage
- **imp7_2.py**:  top trading cycle algorithm, which gets preferences of the agents and outputs a stable
permutation
